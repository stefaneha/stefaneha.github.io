<u>Abstract</u>: Aims: Children with dyscalculia usually experience less self-efficacy and more anxiety while engaging in mathematical tasks. Aside from fundamental difficulties in basic numerical skills, such non-cognitive factors can negatively impact their mathematics achievement. On the other hand, game elements were found to increase performance, motivation, and engagement. Accordingly, the present study evaluated the effects of game elements in mathematical tasks for children with dyscalculia. Methods: 60 children (25 girls, 35 boys) with learning disorders (dyscalculia group: N = 22 children with isolated dyscalculia and 13 children with comorbid dyscalculia and dyslexia; dyslexia group: N = 25 children with dyslexia) aged 7.1 to 14.7 years (M=124 months, SD=20 months) participated in the study. All children completed a number line estimation task presented in three different formats: i) a digital version with game elements, ii) a digital version without game elements, and iii) a conventional paper-pencil version. Findings: While children in the dyscalculia group showed higher trait mathematics anxiety and higher estimation errors than those in the dyslexia group, no performance differences were observed between task formats. However, the digital version with game elements was significantly preferred by participants across both groups. Furthermore, even in the absence of any performance feedback, children perceived themselves to perform best when game elements were present compared to the other two versions without game elements. Significance: These results substantiate the use of game elements in mathematical tasks to support children with learning disorders by increasing their experience of the task as well as performance expectations.
