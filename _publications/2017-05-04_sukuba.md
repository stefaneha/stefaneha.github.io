Enthalpies and free energies of reaction for small neutral and charged beryllium deuterides BeD, BeD<sub>2</sub>, and BeD<sub>3</sub> that have been calculated are reported for a temperature range of 0 K to 1000 K. We discuss probable dissociation channels and possible ways of producing BeD by localizing the relevant transition states and by calculating corresponding rate constants. BeD and BeD<sup>+</sup> are found to be the most stable ones among the considered compounds. BeD<sub>2</sub> and BeD<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> are more likely to decompose into Be<sup>0,+</sup> + D<sub>2</sub> than into BeD<sup>0,+</sup> + D. The metastable BeD<sub>3</sub> and BeD<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> predominantly decompose into BeD<sup>0,+</sup> + D<sub>2</sub>. In light of our results on the reaction energetics, we can interpret the pathways for production of BeD via BeD<sub>2</sub> and BeD<sub>3</sub> intermediates observed in molecular dynamics simulations.
