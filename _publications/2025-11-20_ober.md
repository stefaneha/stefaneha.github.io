<i>Silent Lights</i> is an educational game designed to raise awareness and foster understanding of light pollution as well as its ecological and societal impacts. Aimed primarily at K-12 students but suitable for broader audiences, the game integrates scientific learning with interactive exploration. Players take on the role of a city employee tasked with optimizing an urban lighting system, balancing ecological preservation and economic efficiency. Through experimentation, feedback, and problem-solving, they learn how different lighting parameters can affect species, ecosystems, and sustainability goals. By simulating real-world trade-offs, Silent Lights aims at promoting systems thinking, critical  eflection, and responsible environmental decision-making in an engaging and playful format.
