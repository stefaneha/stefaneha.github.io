There is a growing interest in developing gamified learning solutions to address educational challenges. However, learning is highly influenced by the conditions in which it takes place (e.g., does gamified learning in a laboratory setting replicate the outcomes of gamified learning online at home?). Hence, it is crucial to understand the boundary conditions of different learning contexts to effectively implement gamified interventions that provide optimal learner support. This work contributes to such an understanding by assessing how general contextual aspects of three studies on gamified learning influence cognitive learning and motivational outcomes. Therefore, we re-examined the results of two earlier published online studies (Study 1: <i>n</i> = 285; Study 2: <i>n</i> = 61) and compared the results to a recently conducted laboratory study (Study 3: <i>n</i> = 121), all of which employed the same associative learning task. Comparing results through a Bayesian lens, we find that motivational outcomes induced by gamification differ substantially between contexts. In contrast, cognitive learning outcomes seem comparatively robust across different contextual factors, with some indication of subtle influences in agreement with cognitive learning theories. Implications are discussed for future empirical research on learning, highlighting how a better understanding of boundary conditions of gamified learning interventions could open perspectives for context-aware educational interventions.
