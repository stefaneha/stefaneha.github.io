We report total electron-impact ionisation cross sections (EICSs) of cisplatin, its hydrolysis products and transplatin in the energy range from threshold to 10 keV using the binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) and its relativistic variant (RBEB), and the Deutsch-Märk (DM) methods. We find reasonable agreement between all three methods, and we also note that the RBEB and the BEB methods yield very similar (almost identical) results in the considered energy range. For cisplatin, the resulting EICSs yield cross section maxima of 22.09 × 10^−20 m^2 at 55.4 eV for the DM method and 18.67 × 10^−20 m^2 at 79.2 eV for the (R)BEB method(s). The EICSs of monoaquated cisplatin yield maxima of 12.54 × 10^−20 m^2 at 82.8 eV for the DM method and of 9.74 × 10^−20 m^2 at 106 eV for the (R)BEB method(s), diaquated cisplatin yields maxima of 7.56 × 10^−20 m^2 at 118.5 eV for the DM method and of 5.77 × 10^−20 m^2 at 136 eV for the (R)BEB method(s). Molecular geometry does not affect the resulting EICS significantly, which is also reflected in very similar EICSs of the cis- and trans-isomer. Limitations of the work as well as desirable future directions in the research area are discussed.
