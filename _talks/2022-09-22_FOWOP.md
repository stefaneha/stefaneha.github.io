<u>Abstract</u>: With this presentation I would like to offer a perspective on academia from which a humanist point of view emerges not as an arbitrary choice among a multitude of interchangeable others but of constitutional importance for institutions aspiring to free research and its teaching, both from an ethical and an epistemic angle. By reflecting on foundational prerequisites necessarily required to be met by communities in order to form particularly epistemic (or artistic) communities, I shall argue (i) that academic practice must incorporate political aspects and (ii) that not recognizing, appreciating and cultivating this facet is likely to drive corroding both its intrinsic meaning and its legitimacy as a public good.
