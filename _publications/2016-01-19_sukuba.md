We report calculated electron impact ionization cross sections (EICSs) of beryllium-tungsten clusters, Be<sub>n</sub>W with n = 1, . . . , 12, from the ionization threshold to 10 keV using the Deutsch-Märk (DM) and the binary-encounter-Bethe (BEB) formalisms. The positions of the maxima of DM and BEB cross sections are mostly close to each other. The DM cross sections are more sensitive with respect to the cluster size. For the clusters smaller than Be<sub>4</sub>W they yield smaller cross sections than BEB and vice versa larger cross sections than BEB for clusters larger than Be<sub>6</sub>W. The maximum cross section values for the singlet-spin groundstate clusters range from 7.0 × 10<sup>-16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> at 28 eV (BeW) to 54.2 × 10<sup>-16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> at 43 eV (Be<sub>12</sub>W) for the DM cross sections and from 13.5 × 10<sup>-16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> at 43 eV (BeW) to 38.9 × 10<sup>-16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> at 43 eV (Be<sub>12</sub>W) for the BEB cross sections. Differences of the EICSs in different isomers and between singlet and triplet states are also explored. Both the DM and BEB cross sections could be fitted perfectly to a simple expression used in modeling and simulation codes in the framework of nuclear fusion research.
