We report calculations of total (and absolute) electron-impact ionization cross sections (EICSs) for the fusion-relevant diatomic molecular species BeH, BeN, BeO, WH, WBe, WN, WO, O<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub> by means of the Deutsch-Märk and the  binary-encounter-Bethe methods in the energy range from threshold to 10 keV. In addition, we discuss an empirical scheme to estimate partial cross sections from the total ones based on reaction energetics and empirical threshold laws and explore its accuracy by assessing available experimental data on total and partial EICSs. Finally, we also report parameters obtained by fitting the calculated cross sections to an expression commonly used in fusion edge plasma modeling.
