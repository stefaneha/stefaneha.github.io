A collection of courses I am currently teaching (or was teaching not long ago or will be teaching very soon).

Computer Application of Statistics
------
A one-semester lab course in the Bachelor's program in Psychology, which I have been teaching at the [University of Graz](https://www.uni-graz.at/en/){:target="_blank"} in each summer semester since 2022 (typically two groups with about 25 students in each group).

Introduction to Bayesian Estimation and Hypothesis Testing from and for Applied Researchers 1 & 2
------
Two 90-minute workshops, each held as part of the [29th JURE 2025 pre-conference](https://www.earli.org/events/jure2025){:target="_blank"} together with my colleague and friend in statistics and many other nerdy things Hanna Rajh-Weber.
