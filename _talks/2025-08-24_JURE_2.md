<u>Abstract</u>: In this hands-on workshop we will go through some typical research problems and how to address them with Bayesian methods in easily accessible software. In particular, we cover correlations, linear regression, t-tests, ANOVAs and show how to perform these typical procedures in JASP and R. Step-by-step guides will be provided so that participants can try these methods on their own PC. For each research problem we contrast the Bayesian approach, using Bayes factor, with its frequentist counterpart. Among other things, we discuss the Bayes factor for hypothesis testing, because this has the substantial advantage of being capable to provide relative evidence for both the null and alternative hypothesis. Lastly, we present how Bayesian results can be interpreted and reported in scientific work.
